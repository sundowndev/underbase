First, install the cli app using npm or yarn.

It is recommended to install `underbase` globally :

```bash
npm i underbase -g
# or...
yarn global add underbase
```

You can also install the package locally

```bash
npm i underbase --save-dev
yarn add underbase --dev
```

### Verify installation

```bash
underbase --help
# or...
./node_modules/underbase/build/cli.js --help
```

It should output the help message.

See [module usage](module-usage) to learn how to use the library as a module.
